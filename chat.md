Your project sounds like a fun and useful system to work on! Since you've already started by writing a `Visitor` class, you have a good base to build upon. Below is a rough outline of how I would approach building this customer queue management system in Python. I'll break it down into high-level steps, key components, and the relationships between them.

### 1. **Define Key Components (Classes and Structures)**

#### a) **Visitor Class**
   - **Purpose**: Stores information about each visitor.
   - **Attributes**:
     - `visitor_id`: A unique identifier for each visitor.
     - `name`: The name of the visitor (optional).
     - `purpose`: The purpose of the visit (optional or required depending on design).
     - `arrival_time`: Timestamp of when the visitor signed in.
     - `status`: Current status (waiting, called, served).
   - **Methods**:
     - `get_wait_time()`: Returns the waiting time based on the arrival time.
     - `set_status(status)`: Updates the visitor's status (waiting, called, etc.).

#### b) **Queue Class**
   - **Purpose**: Manages the queue of visitors.
   - **Attributes**:
     - `queue`: A list (or deque) to store visitors in the order they sign in.
     - `purpose_queues`: A dictionary of queues, one for each purpose.
   - **Methods**:
     - `add_visitor(visitor)`: Adds a visitor to the appropriate queue.
     - `get_next(visitor_order=True)`: Returns the next visitor based on either FIFO or purpose-based sorting.
     - `remove_visitor(visitor)`: Removes a visitor once they've been served.
     - `get_waiting_count(purpose=None)`: Returns how many visitors are waiting, optionally filtered by purpose.
     - `get_all_waiting()`: Returns a list of all waiting visitors with their waiting times.

#### c) **Desk Operator Class (or Manager Class)**
   - **Purpose**: Manages the logic of calling visitors, tracking state, etc.
   - **Attributes**:
     - `queue`: The main queue instance.
     - `current_visitor`: The visitor who is currently being served (if any).
   - **Methods**:
     - `call_next(visitor_order=True)`: Calls the next visitor in the queue.
     - `serve_visitor(visitor)`: Marks a visitor as served and removes them from the queue.
     - `get_waiting_visitors()`: Returns a list of waiting visitors (could be filtered by purpose).
     - `change_queue_order(strategy)`: Allows changing the queue order (FIFO or purpose-then-FIFO).

### 2. **Data Structures**

   - **Queues**:
     - **FIFO Queue**: A simple queue where visitors are served in the order they arrived. You can use a `collections.deque` for efficient appending and popping.
     - **Purpose-based Queue**: A dictionary where each key is a purpose, and the value is a queue for that specific purpose. For example:
       ```python
       {'general': deque(), 'technical': deque(), 'billing': deque()}
       ```
     - You can switch between FIFO and purpose-first sorting dynamically based on desk operator preference.

---

### 3. **System Workflow**

   - **Sign-in Process**: 
     - When a visitor arrives, they can either provide a purpose or choose a generic purpose (e.g., "General Inquiry").
     - The visitor is added to the main queue. If they specify a purpose, they are added to the queue for that purpose as well.

   - **Desk Operator Calls a Visitor**:
     - The operator can either call the next visitor based on FIFO or by purpose (e.g., call the 'billing' visitors first, then the 'technical' ones, all FIFO within the purpose).
     - This can be handled by a `call_next()` method that checks the current queue order mode (FIFO or purpose-first).

   - **Waiting Time Tracking**: 
     - Every visitor's waiting time is tracked from when they signed in. The `get_wait_time()` method in the `Visitor` class can compute this.
     - The system can also provide a count of how many visitors are waiting for each purpose.

### 4. **API (Optional for Future Web Interface)**

Even though you’re focused on the Python backend right now, it's useful to think ahead about how you might structure an API for interacting wit the system.

   - **Endpoints**:
     - `POST /sign_in`: Adds a visitor to the queue. Takes `name` and `purpose` (optional) in the payload.
     - `GET /queue`: Returns a list of visitors currently waiting, optionally filtered by purpose.
     - `GET /next`: Calls the next visitor based on the current queue order strategy.
     - `POST /serve`: Marks a visitor as served and removes them from the queue.
     - `GET /waiting_time/{visitor_id}`: Returns the waiting time for a specific visitor.

---

### 5. **Persistence (Optional for Now)**

If you want to persist data (for example, to keep track of visitors across restarts), you can add a basic persistence layer. For now, a simple file-based approach (e.g., using JSON or SQLite) should suffice, but you can scale it later.

   - **File-Based Persistence**: You can write the state of the queue to a JSON file when visitors sign in, when a visitor is served, etc. Upon starting the system, you could load the data back into memory.
   - **SQLite (Optional)**: If you plan to scale this project later, you can use a small SQLite database to store visitor and queue data.

---

### 6. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

Since you don’t have a web interface yet, it might be useful to add a simple command-line interface to interact with the queue and desk operator.

   - **CLI Commands**:
     - `sign_in <name> <purpose>`: Adds a visitor.
     - `call_next`: Calls the next visitor.
     - `serve <visitor_id>`: Marks a visitor as served.
     - `status`: Shows current queue status (how many visitors are waiting, etc.).
     - `waiting_time <visitor_id>`: Shows the waiting time for a specific visitor.

---

### 7. **Sample Workflow**

Here’s an example of how the system might flow:

1. **Visitor Signs In**:  
   Visitor John signs in with purpose "Technical Support". He is added to both the main queue and the "technical" purpose queue.

2. **Operator Calls Visitor**:  
   The operator might call the next visitor from the "technical" queue (if sorting by purpose is enabled) or from the main queue if FIFO is preferred.

3. **Waiting Time Tracking**:  
   While John is waiting, the system tracks how long he has been in the queue. You could periodically check how long each visitor has been waiting, potentially showing this information to the operator.

4. **Visitor is Served**:  
   After John is served, the system removes him from the queue.

### 8. **Future Considerations**

   - **Web Interface**: When you add a web interface, you can build REST APIs (as described above) to interact with your backend system. You might use Flask or FastAPI for this.
   - **QR Code**: For QR sign-ins, you could generate a QR code linking to a specific API endpoint that allows a visitor to sign in via their phone.
   - **Real-Time Updates**: For real-time updates in the future, consider using WebSockets or long polling for updating visitors and their statuses.

### Final Thoughts

This approach splits the project into manageable parts: defining your data structures (visitor, queue, operator), implementing the core queue management functionality, and setting up a basic CLI for testing. With this foundation, you can start small, focusing on the core logic, and then build up from there, eventually adding a web interface and persistence.
