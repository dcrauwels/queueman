# To-do
## Short-term
- Make CLI work.
- Implement persistence in SQL
- Think out and implement Operator class
- Visitor ID is flawed atm in terms of implementation. Perhaps unique ID is better and the uuid lib would help.

## Long-term
- Web interface
- Some type of security
- Statistics, e.g. through https://github.com/andrewyng/aisuite
