# To-do
## Short-term
- Think out and implement Operator class
- Implement call command in CLI.
- Implement operator command in CLI.

## Long-term
- Implement persistence in SQL
- Web interface
- Some type of security
- Statistics, e.g. through https://github.com/andrewyng/aisuite

# Completed
- Visitor ID is flawed atm in terms of implementation. Perhaps unique ID is better and the uuid lib would help.
- Make CLI work. > in the sense that add and view commands work
